# Jonathan NÃ¶ther
I am a Data Science and Artificial Intelligence M.Sc. Student at Saarland University interested in secure and safe machine learning. I am currently employed as an research assistant at Max-Planck Institute for Software Systems, where I study red-teaming and attacks of foundation models and LLMs. 

## Publications
- **Text-Diffusion Red-Teaming of Large Language Models:
Unveiling Harmful Behaviors with Proximity Constraints**  
With Adish Singla and Goran Radanovic  
*Under Review at COLM*
- **Defending Against Unknown Corrupted Agents: Reinforcement Learning of Adversarially Robust Nash Equilibria**  
With Andi Nika, Adish Singla, Goran Radanovic  
*Under Review at TMLR*
- **[Implicit poisoning attacks in two-agent reinforcement learning: Adversarial policies for training-time attacks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.13851)**  
With Mohammad Mohammadi, Debmalya Mandal, Adish Singla, Goran Radanovic  
*AAMAS 2023*

## Projects
- **Interview Performance Prediction and Lie Detection**  
Implementation of model that evaluated the performance and detected lies of
a participant of mock-job interviews
- **[Inpaiting Detection](https://github.com/HLCV-23/Inpainting-Detection)**  
Combine automatic segmentation with inpainting to automatically create edited images.
Additionally experimented with detecting these faked images.
- **Safe Streets**  
Extend pedestrian route recommendation by taking into account the safety of the route
(e.g. lights, open shops).
